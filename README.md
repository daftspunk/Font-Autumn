# Font Autumn

## The iconic font designed for use with OctoberCMS

The full suite of pictographic icons, examples, and documentation can be found at:

## Remember when Font-Awesome was cool?

We do, that's why this repository uses:

* Font files from version 4
* LESS styles from version 3
* Documentation from version 2

We'll also be adding some more icon packs later down the track.
